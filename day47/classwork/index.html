        <div class="item1">I recived a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the comapny I joined. I <br> honestly feel i got every pennys's worth. <br>
           <span class="w">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transtiton and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incerdibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruieling - time of my life. Since completing the course. I've successfully switched careers. working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup"</span></div>

        <div class="item2">The Team was very supportive and kept me motivated <br> 
            <span class="qer">"I started as a total newbie with<br> virtually no coding skills. I now work<br> as a mobile engineer for a big<br> company. This was one of the best<br>investments I've made i myself"</span></div>

        <div class="item3">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! <br> 
        <span class="qer1">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from professionals<br> who can help me learn proggramming<br> step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former student of theirs<br> who can only say a wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> cirruiculm abd staff did not<br> dissapoint. They were very hands-on<br> and i neer had to wait long for<br> assistance. The aigle team project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial could ever have. In<br> fact, I've often referred to during<br> interviews as an exapmle of my<br> development expirience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after reciving mutiple<br> offers. 100% reccomended!"</span></div>

        <div class="item4">An overall wonderful<br> and rewarding<br> experience<br><br>

            "The staff seem genuienly concerned about my proggress wich i find really refreshing. The<br> program gave me the confidence to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable junior developer. The standart is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "</span></div>

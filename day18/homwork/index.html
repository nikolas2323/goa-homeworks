I like dogs because they are always frindly and will protect you<br>
I like cats because they are chill<br>
I like capybaras because they are funny looking<br>
I like hamsters because they are easy to take care of<br>
I like bald eagles because they are very cool animals, they are strong fast can see very far and they are the national birds of USA.
